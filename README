GnomeShell theme changer v0.1
(very) simple theme changer for the GnomeShell

I've written this simple script in order to replace the (far better) theme selector from fpmurphy.com. 
As I had some issues running this extension on GnomeShell 3.2, I wanted to provide another way to
change GnomeShell themes easily.

Dependencies:

* Python (2 or 3)
* pygobject introspection
* the gnome-shell extension "user theme"
